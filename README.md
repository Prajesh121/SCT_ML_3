\## 📊 Features Used



\- Input Flattened images of packages (resized to 64x64 pixels)  

\- Target `Good Product` vs `Defective Product`  



Note The dataset is originally images of cats and dogs, repurposed to simulate good vs defective products.

\## 📁 Dataset



\- Folder `train` containing images  

\- Classes `Good Product` and `Defective Product`  

\- Limit 500 images per class for faster training  



Optional You can expand the dataset for better accuracy.
